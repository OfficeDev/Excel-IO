# Excel.IO

The goal of this project is to simplify reading and writing Excel workbooks so that the developer only needs to pass a collection of objects to write a workbook. Likewise, when reading a workbook the developer supplies a class with properties that map to column names to read a collection of those objects from the workbook. 

Excel.IO takes a single dependency on the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) and targets .NET Standard 2.0

## Features

* Easy to use developer API
* Write one or more worksheets per workbook by passing a collection of strongly typed objects
* Read one or more worksheets from a workbook into a collection of strongly typed objects

## Limitations

* Assumes workbook structure where the first row has column headers
* Reading multiple worksheets is a little inefficient
* Localisation isn't currently supported 

## Example: Writing a worksheet

Implement [IExcelRow](../master/src/Excel.IO/IExcelRow.cs) and define the columns of the spreadsheet as public properties:

```csharp
public class Person : IExcelRow
{
    public string SheetName { get => "People Sheet"; }

    public string EyeColour { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }

    public int Height { get; set; }
}
```

Then create instances and pass a collection to an instance of [ExcelConverter](../master/src/Excel.IO/ExcelConverter.cs) to write a single sheet workbook with several rows:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>();

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  people.Add(new Person
  {
    EyeColour = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    Age = new Random().Next(1, 100),
    Height = new Random().Next(100, 200)
  });
}

var excelConverter = new ExcelConverter();
excelConverter.Write(people, "C:\\somefolder\\people.xlsx");
```

## Example: Reading a worksheet

Implement [IExcelRow](../master/src/Excel.IO/IExcelRow.cs) and define public properties with the same name as columns of the spreadsheet (we'll just reuse the same class from above):

```csharp
public class Person : IExcelRow
{
    public string SheetName { get => "People Sheet"; }

    public string EyeColour { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }

    public int Height { get; set; }
}
```

Then, ask an instance of [ExcelConverter](../master/src/Excel.IO/ExcelConverter.cs) to read an IEnumerable<Person> from disk:

```csharp
var excelConverter = new ExcelConverter();
var people = excelConverter.Read<Person>("C:\\somefolder\\people.xlsx");

foreach(var person in people)
{
  //do something useful with the data
}
```
